# piano_roll_browser    
a music sequencer inspired by LMMS, one of the best software applications ever!     
    
This project is currently still a very early prototype. more to come! (^_^\)    
    
features I would like to implement:    
- ability to add more voices/instruments + 'onion skin' to see the other instruments' notes like in PxTone Collage    
- ability to change color of highlight and color of note blocks    
- be able to make custom sounds!    
- allow staccato, legato, and maybe note glides and bends? for individual notes maybe? 
    
Additionally, I want to think about how I can modularize what I have so that my functions are not so specific to my implmentation (i.e. a lot of my functions currently rely on specific element id's. it would be nice I think to use these functions by instead passing in an id so that they can be used more flexibly and possibly in other projects. )
