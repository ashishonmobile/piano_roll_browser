# piano_roll_browser    
a music sequencer inspired by LMMS, one of the best software applications ever!   
also carries a bit of influence from PxTone Collage, another great piece of software!    
    
This project is currently still a very early prototype. more to come! (^_^\)    

### instructions:
right-click blocks on the grid to create 16th notes, or rejoin 16th notes to revert back to 8th notes.    
right-click an instrument to modify its sound and name.    
check out a demo! see the demo dropdown box.    

### known problems:
notes getting torn past 150 (need to check what's happening to duration calculations).    
still need to delete measures, instruments.    
still need to be able to join notes.    
need to make volume adjustable for each instrument.    
    
### features I would like to implement:    
- ability to change color of highlight and color of note blocks, i.e. different for each new instrument    
- be able to make custom sounds!    
- allow staccato, legato, and maybe note glides and bends? for individual notes maybe?    
- be able to record playback
    
other notes:    
if staccato and legato notes can be implemented, the amount of time a note is heard will be different but the amount of time total for that note (i.e. a staccato note might be 100ms of sound + 300ms of silence -> for 400ms total time per note, while legato might be 400ms of sound with no silence). I think the gliding from one note to another is caused by using a certain oscillator method - check the comments in the source.    

### implementation / design:    
info about that goes here
