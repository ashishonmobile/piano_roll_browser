# piano_roll_browser    
a music sequencer inspired by LMMS, one of the best software applications ever!   
also carries a bit of influence from PxTone Collage, another great piece of software!    
    
This project is currently still a very early prototype. more to come! (^_^\)    
    
features I would like to implement:    
- ability to change color of highlight and color of note blocks, i.e. different for each new instrument    
- be able to make custom sounds!    
- allow staccato, legato, and maybe note glides and bends? for individual notes maybe?    
- be able to save work and download data in JSON / import data in JSON to continue a project 
- be able to record playback
    
other notes:    
if staccato and legato notes can be implemented, the amount of time a note is heard will be different but the amount of time total for that note (i.e. a staccato note might be 100ms of sound + 300ms of silence -> for 400ms total time per note, while legato might be 400ms of sound with no silence). I think the gliding from one note to another is caused by using a certain oscillator method - check the comments in the source.
