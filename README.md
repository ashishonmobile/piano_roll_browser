# piano_roll_browser    
a music sequencer inspired by LMMS, one of the best software applications ever!     
    
This project is currently still a very early prototype. more to come! (^_^\)    
    
features I would like to implement:    
- ability to add more voices/instruments + 'onion skin' to see the other instruments' notes like in PxTone Collage    
- ability to change color of highlight and color of note blocks    
- be able to make custom sounds!    
- allow staccato, legato, and maybe note glides and bends? for individual notes maybe?
